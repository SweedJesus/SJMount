#SJMount
###Add-on utility for automatically controling mount selection
- Highly-configurable
	- Configureable ingame via slash-commands or out-of-game via config files
	- Mount white-listing/black-listing
	- Zone-specific mount lists
	- Indoor/outdoor preference
- Low memory usage
	- No GUI
- Module-like design
	- Intended to be used via macros

####Notes (for me)
- **Renaming files** After having renamed files that have been added to repository...<br>
	1. Recursively remove cached files ( "git rm --cached 'old source paths' -r" )<br>
	2. Add renamed source files<br>
	3. Commit and push<br>
